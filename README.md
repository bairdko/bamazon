# SQL Database App
###### Assigned: 8/23/18

#### Mechanics
This is a SQL database app homework assigned during bootcamp. This was the first introduction to creating SQL databases. It is a very basic shopping app, where you can purchase from the inventory.

**Known issues:** None

**Potential Improvements:** This does not have a ton of functionality, it could do a lot more. Also, it needs a front end.
